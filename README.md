## UX

### Site Purpose:
To help the customer find the location, request bookings, have a peak at the menus and draw attention to our ongoing events.

### Site Goal:
To regularly update our current users with the latest information, get them to make their bookings over the website, draw attention to social media (->followers) and build a base of regular visitors.

### Audience:
Cocktail enthusiasts and those who want to become one. Our target group are all people between the ages of 21-60. 

### Communication:
With a minimalistic design,  information is easy to find by all who visit the site. With this approach we avoid an overload of information and ensure that the most important parts are conveyes to the customers. Also the operating hours and location are available throughout all the pages, to remind our audience immediately of when we are open and where to find us.

### Current User Goals:
- To see updates on upcoming events and changes in the menus

### New User Goals:
- to navigate the site with ease & clearly understand the information that is being provided.
- for the information to be relevant & up-to-date.
- to be inspired by a striking design that captures my immediate interest,
and keeps my focus on the site.

## Design

### Colour Scheme:
The color palette was kept very simplistic with black and #blanchedalmond as background colors for content and header/footer respectively. 
Colors come almost exclusively from the background pictures.
For the text-color I used black for the header and footer. This was switched around in the main sections where I used #F4EADB (=var(--menu-color)) as the text color and made the background black. This ensures nice contrast and readibility and provides extra separation between header/footer elements and the main content. 

To make clickable links and menu-navigation obvious to the user all of these items turn #chocolate when hovered upon. This slightly darker color also matches nicely with the #blanchedalmond background. This light brown can also be distinguished easily from the black background in the Hours/Location section.(->google maps link)

### Typography:
https://fontjoy.com/ was used to find matching fonts for the header font Dancing Script.
There I choose the following 3 fonts for the website:
They are declared in the :root selector in the beginning of the styles.css file:
:root {
    --header: Dancing Script, cursive;
    --subheader: Merriweather Sans, sans-serif;
    --text: Rubik, sans-serif;
}

The Dancing Script font matches with the 'dancing' Theme Name of the site and gives the site an artsy and musical touch. The subheader and text fonts are simpler to make it easy to find menu elements and ensure content is easy to read.
